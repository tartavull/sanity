# Sanity  
**A macOS status bar app for people who’ve had enough of calendars, clocks, and dead Roman guys.**

Ever tried to figure out how many days are left until **February 16th** and ended up:
- Counting on your fingers,
- Googling “is it a leap year??”,
- And briefly contemplating time as a social construct?

Yeah. Same.

## ✨ What Sanity Does

Sanity puts two tiny numbers in your Mac’s status bar.  
Like this:  
```
101st   93.7%
```

Which means:
- It’s the **101st day of the year** (let’s say April 11)
- And **93.7% of the day is over** (so maybe stop starting new projects?)

That’s it. No months. No weeks. No "what day is it?" panic. Just cold, numerical comfort.

## 🤯 Why This Exists

Because calendars are cursed.  
Months are uneven.  
February has an identity crisis.  
And "October" is somehow the **tenth** month?

Trying to understand time is like debugging legacy code written by a Pope, a Roman emperor, and a bored monk — all drunk.

So instead of asking,  
> “How many days until Feb 16?”  

Just go:  
> “It’s day 47. I’ve got 39 to go.”  

Clean. Logical. Caesar-proof.

## ⏳ But Wait — Clocks Are Also Dumb

Let’s talk about time.

- 24 hours?
- 60 minutes per hour?
- 60 seconds per minute?

Congratulations, you’ve unlocked **base-60** hell.

Sanity says:  
> “66.4% of the day is done.”

Which tells you:
- You’re two-thirds through.
- You’ve got ~7.5 hours left.
- Each percent = ~15 minutes (handy and oddly satisfying)

Your brain loves this. Your ancestors? Probably not.

## 🤓 So, Why Bother?

Honestly?  
No reason. This app won’t change your life.  
It just makes time suck **slightly less**.

It’s a petty act of rebellion against:
- Pope Gregory XIII,
- Julius Caesar,
- And whoever designed April to feel 74 days long.

Use it.  
Stare at it.  
Forget what “Wednesday” means — you’re on **day 101** now.
